            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>A success driven individual with a greater than self purpose. While working at a third-party fraud and dispute processing company, PSCU/CO-OP, I found a passion for transparent financial systems and bringing new technology to those who cannot dedicate their time to learn the fancy new technology. Technology should be easily utilizable by those who have access to it. I am now studying for a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Computer Science, with my education I aim to "saddle" the innovative technology brought to us by AI, blockchain and virtual reality. The future of the world is currently riding on the brains of the technology industry, I am dedicated to my work. An educated, efficient and relaxed attitude allows for me to manage stressful, or time-intensive tasks without scrupulous stress. Ultimately, I am preparing myself for a life of technology and innovation, anticipating what the new age of technology will bring.</p>
